== About OSToy

OSToy is a simple Node.js application that we will deploy to Azure Red Hat OpenShift.
It is used to help us explore the functionality of Kubernetes.
This application has a user interface which you can:

* write messages to the log (stdout / stderr)
* intentionally crash the application to view self-healing
* toggle a liveness probe and monitor OpenShift behavior
* read config maps, secrets, and env variables
* if connected to shared storage, read and write files
* check network connectivity, intra-cluster DNS, and intra-communication with an included microservice
* increase the load to view automatic scaling of the pods to handle the load (via the Horizontal Pod Autoscaler)
* connect to an Azure Blob Storage container to read and write objects (if Blob Storage already present)
