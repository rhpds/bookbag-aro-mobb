= Explore OpenShift authentication using AAD

[WARNING]
====
Only do the module for Azure Active Directory that your instructor told you to do. If you just set up Azure AD yourself move on to the next module.

https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/active-directory[Azure Active Directory] is a fully managed authentication, authorization, and user management service provided by Microsoft Azure. It simplifies the process of adding user sign-up, sign-in, and access control to your ARO Cluster. Integrating your ARO cluster with Azure Active Directory simplifies user authentication, provides secure access control, supports federated identity and SSO, and enables centralized user management and audit trails.

As part of the Access Your Cluster page, we utilized a temporary cluster-admin user using the `az aro list-credentials` command. This uses a local identity provider to allow you to access the cluster. In this section of the workshop, we'll configure Azure Active Directory as the cluster identity provider in your ARO cluster.

Your ARO cluster has a built-in OAuth server. Developers and administrators do not really directly interact with the OAuth server itself, but instead interact with an external identity provider (such as Azure Active Directory) which is brokered by the OAuth server in the cluster. To learn more about cluster authentication, visit the https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/latest/authentication/understanding-identity-provider.html[Red Hat documentation for identity provider configuration] and the https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/openshift/configure-azure-ad-cli[Microsoft documentation for configuring Azure Active Directory authentication for ARO].

The following diagram illustrates the ARO authentication process for a cluster configured with Azure Active Directory.

In your environment an Azure Active Directory has been configured with two users:

* Admin user: `%openenv_admin_upn%`. This user has administrative access to the Azure Portal as well as cluster-admin authorization on the ARO cluster.
* Regular user:  `%openenv_user_upn%`. This user only has user level permissions with no useful access to the Azure portal or ARO cluster.

[NOTE]
====
Both users have been assigned the temporary password `%bastion_password%`. You *must* change this password when you first log into the Azure portal.
====

== Azure Portal and change admin password

The Azure Portal URL is https://portal.azure.com.

. Open a new web browser window/tab and log into the Azure Portal by navigating to https://portal.azure.com.
. Use `%openenv_admin_upn%` as the user id and `%bastion_password%` as the password to log into the portal.
. You will be prompted to change your password. Use `%bastion_password%` as the current password and pick a password that you will remember throughout this lab. Make sure this password is reasonably complex. An example could be `Firstname-Lastname-Admin2023` (using your first and last name).
. Click `Maybe Later` when asked if you want to take a tour of the Azure portal.

== Explore ARO

. In the search bar at the top type `aro` and then click on *Azure Red Hat OpenShift Clusters*.
+
You will see your cluster `aro-cluster-%guid%`.

. Click on your cluster to open the cluster properties.
. Click on *Settings* -> *Properties* to bring up the cluster overview.

== Log into OpenShift using Azure Credentials

Now that your password has been changed for the Azure admin account you can use single sign on to log into your OpenShift cluster.

. Navigate back to the OpenShift console at %aro_console%.
. This time click on `AAD` when prompted for which authentication provider to use.
. Use `%openenv_admin_upn%` as the user and the password that you set for the Azure portal to log into the console.
+
[TIP]
====
If you are still logged into the Azure portal in the same browser this will be easy - Azure will present you with a list of users. Simply select your admin user. And because this is single sign on you will not even have to provide your password.
====

== Log into OpenShift CLI using Azure Credentials

. Log into the terminal window that you have been using so far using the same user.
+
On the top right of the OpenShift web console click on your user and then *Copy login command*.

. Confirm by clicking on `AAD` and selecting your account again.
. Click on *Display Token*
. Copy the displayed login command under *Log in with this token* and paste it into the terminal window to log in with that user.
. Double check that you are logged in as your Azure user:
+
[source,sh,role=execute]
----
oc whoami
----
+
.Sample Output
[source,texinfo,options=nowrap]
----
openenv-admin-%guid%@azure.opentlc.com
----

You now have full admin access to both the Azure console and the OpenShift console.
