= Configuring Azure AD for Cluster Authentication

[WARNING]
====
Only do the module for Azure Active Directory that your instructor told you to do. If Azure AD is already preconfigured move on to the next module.
====

https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/active-directory[Azure Active Directory] is a fully managed authentication, authorization, and user management service provided by Microsoft Azure. It simplifies the process of adding user sign-up, sign-in, and access control to your ARO Cluster. Integrating your ARO cluster with Azure Active Directory simplifies user authentication, provides secure access control, supports federated identity and SSO, and enables centralized user management and audit trails.

As part of the Access Your Cluster page, we utilized a temporary cluster-admin user using the `az aro list-credentials` command. This uses a local identity provider to allow you to access the cluster. In this section of the workshop, we'll configure Azure Active Directory as the cluster identity provider in your ARO cluster.

Your ARO cluster has a built-in OAuth server. Developers and administrators do not really directly interact with the OAuth server itself, but instead interact with an external identity provider (such as Azure Active Directory) which is brokered by the OAuth server in the cluster. 

The following diagram illustrates the ARO authentication process for a cluster configured with Azure Active Directory.

To learn more about cluster authentication, visit the https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/latest/authentication/understanding-identity-provider.html[Red Hat documentation for identity provider configuration] and the https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/openshift/configure-azure-ad-cli[Microsoft documentation for configuring Azure Active Directory authentication for ARO].

== Configure our Azure AD application

. First, we need to determine the OAuth callback URL, which we will use to tell Azure AD where it should send authentication responses.
+
To do so, run the following command:
+
[source,sh,role=execute]
----
IDP_CALLBACK=$(oc get route -n openshift-authentication oauth-openshift -o jsonpath='https://{.spec.host}/oauth2callback/AAD')

echo "${IDP_CALLBACK}"
----
+
.Sample Output
[source,text,options=nowrap]
----
https://oauth-openshift.apps.upd83re2.westeurope.aroapp.io/oauth2callback/AAD
----

. Next, let's create a manifest file to configure the AAD application.
To do so, run the following command:
+
[source,sh,role=execute]
----
cat << EOF > $HOME/manifest.json
{
  "idToken": [
    {
      "name": "upn",
      "source": null,
      "essential": false,
      "additionalProperties": []
    },
    {
      "name": "email",
      "source": null,
      "essential": false,
      "additionalProperties": []
    }
  ]
}
EOF
----

. Next, let's use the manifest we created above to create an Azure AD App for your cluster.
To do so, run the following command:
+
[source,sh,role=execute]
----
az ad app create \
  --display-name ${GUID}-idp \
  --web-redirect-uris ${IDP_CALLBACK} \
  --sign-in-audience AzureADMyOrg \
  --optional-claims @$HOME/manifest.json

APPID=$(az ad app list --display-name ${GUID}-idp --query "[].appId" -o tsv)

echo ${APPID}
----
+
.Sample Output
[source,text,options=nowrap]
----
... lots of JSON output...

01d2ddd4-742c-442b-8c00-795cabc00ca8
----

. To allow us to securely sign our authentication requests, we need to create an Azure Service Principal and grab the credentials to authenticate with.
To do so, run the following command:
+
[source,sh,role=execute]
----
az ad sp create --id ${APPID}

az ad sp update --id ${APPID} --set 'tags=["WindowsAzureActiveDirectoryIntegratedApp"]'

IDP_SECRET=$(az ad app credential reset --id ${APPID} --query password -o tsv)

echo ${IDP_SECRET}
----
+
.Sample Output
[source,text,options=nowrap]
----
... Lots of JSON output ...

WARNING: The output includes credentials that you must protect. Be sure that you do not include these credentials in your code or check the credentials into your source control. For more information, see https://aka.ms/azadsp-cli

----

. Next, we need to add permissions to our Azure AD application which grants `read email`, `read profile`, and `read user`.
To do so, run the following command:
+
[source,sh,role=execute]
----
az ad app permission add \
  --api 00000003-0000-0000-c000-000000000000 \
  --api-permissions 64a6cdd6-aab1-4aaf-94b8-3cc8405e90d0=Scope \
  --id ${APPID}

az ad app permission add \
  --api 00000003-0000-0000-c000-000000000000 \
  --api-permissions 14dad69e-099b-42c9-810b-d002981feec1=Scope \
  --id ${APPID}

az ad app permission add \
  --api 00000003-0000-0000-c000-000000000000 \
  --api-permissions e1fe6dd8-ba31-4d61-89e7-88639da4683d=Scope \
  --id ${APPID}
----
+
.Sample Output
[source,text,options=nowrap]
----
Invoking `az ad app permission grant --id 01d2ddd4-742c-442b-8c00-795cabc00ca8 --api 00000003-0000-0000-c000-000000000000` is needed to make the change effective
----
+
[TIP]
====
If you see the output `Invoking az ad app permission grant --id xxxxxxx --api 00000003-0000-0000-c000-000000000000 is needed to make the change effective` you can safely ignore it.
====

== Configure our OpenShift cluster to use Azure AD

. Create a secret to store the service principal secret, above.
To do so, run the following command:
+
[source,sh,role=execute]
----
oc create secret generic openid-client-secret-azuread \
  -n openshift-config \
  --from-literal=clientSecret="${IDP_SECRET}"
----
+
.Sample Output
[source,text,options=nowrap]
----
secret/openid-client-secret-azuread created
----

. Next, let's update the OAuth server's custom resource with our Azure AD configuration.
+
[source,sh,role=execute]
----
AZ_TENANT=$(az account show --query tenantId -o tsv)

cat << EOF | oc apply -f -
---
apiVersion: config.openshift.io/v1
kind: OAuth
metadata:
  name: cluster
spec:
  identityProviders:
  - name: AAD
    mappingMethod: claim
    type: OpenID
    openID:
      clientID: "${APPID}"
      clientSecret:
        name: openid-client-secret-azuread
      extraScopes:
      - email
      - profile
      extraAuthorizeParameters:
        include_granted_scopes: "true"
      claims:
        preferredUsername:
        - email
        - upn
        name:
        - name
        email:
        - email
      issuer: "https://login.microsoftonline.com/${AZ_TENANT}"
EOF
----
+
.Sample Output
[source,text,options=nowrap]
----
Warning: resource oauths/cluster is missing the kubectl.kubernetes.io/last-applied-configuration annotation which is required by oc apply. oc apply should only be used on resources created declaratively by either oc create --save-config or oc apply. The missing annotation will be patched automatically.
oauth.config.openshift.io/cluster configured
----
+
[NOTE]
====
We are specifically requesting `email`, `upn`, and `name` optional claims from Azure AD to populate the data in our user profiles. This is entirely configurable.

If you see the output `Warning: resource oauths/cluster is missing the kubectl.kubernetes.io/last-applied-configuration annotation which is required by oc apply.
oc apply should only be used on resources created declaratively by either oc create --save-config or oc apply.
The missing annotation will be patched automatically.` you can safely ignore this warning.
====

. Watch the authentication pods until all three of them have restarted (hit `Ctrl-C` once you see that all three pods have been restarted):
+
[source,sh,role=execute]
----
watch oc get pod -n openshift-authentication
----
+
.Sample Output
[source,text,options=nowrap]
----
NAME                               READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
oauth-openshift-6686cdfd44-k6jzf   1/1     Running   0          3m7s
oauth-openshift-6686cdfd44-rftbj   1/1     Running   0          4m7s
oauth-openshift-6686cdfd44-rrmcw   1/1     Running   0          3m37s
----

. Next, give Cluster Admin permissions to your AAD user by running the following commands:
+
[source,sh,role=execute]
----
oc adm policy add-cluster-role-to-user cluster-admin \
  openenv-admin-%guid%@azure.opentlc.com
----
+
.Sample Output
[source,text,options=nowrap]
----
Warning: User 'openenv-admin-@azure.opentlc.com' not found
clusterrole.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/cluster-admin added: "openenv-admin-@azure.opentlc.com"
----

. Logout from your OCP Console and browse back to the Console URL (`echo $OCP_CONSOLE` if you have forgotten it) and you should see a new option to login called `AAD`.
+
[TIP]
====
If you do not see a new *AAD* login option, wait a few more minutes as this process can take a few minutes to deploy across the cluster and revisit the Console URL.
====

. Select `AAD`, and log in using the provided Azure credentials:
* *User*: openenv-admin-%guid%@azure.opentlc.com
* *Password*: %bastion_password%

. You will be prompted to change your password. Provide your current password and select a new password that you will remember.
+
It is suggested to use something like *FirstnameLastnameMOBB23*.

. The first time you log in you will also be prompted to accept permissions for the _application_. Click *Accept*.
+
Now you should be logged into the OpenShift Console as user *openenv-admin-%guid%@azure.opentlc.com* with Cluster Administrator permissions.

== Log into OpenShift CLI using Azure Credentials

. Log into the terminal window that you have been using so far using the same user.
+
On the top right of the OpenShift web console click on your user and then *Copy login command*.

. Confirm by clicking on `AAD` and selecting your account again.
. Click on *Display Token*
. Copy the displayed login command under *Log in with this token* and paste it into the terminal window to log in with that user.
. Double check that you are logged in as your Azure user:
+
[source,sh,role=execute]
----
oc whoami
----
+
.Sample Output
[source,texinfo,options=nowrap]
----
openenv-admin-%guid%@azure.opentlc.com
----

You now have full admin access to both the Azure console and the OpenShift console via the Azure AD admin account.

== Summary

Here you learned how to:

* Configure your Azure AD application.
* Configure your cluster to use Azure AD for authentication.
