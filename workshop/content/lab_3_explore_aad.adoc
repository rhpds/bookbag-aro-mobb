== Accessing the Azure Portal and OpenShift authentication using AAD

In your environment an Azure Active Directory has been configured with two users:

* Admin user: `%openenv_admin_upn%`. This user has administrative access to the Azure Portal as well as cluster-admin authorization on the ARO cluster.
* Regular user:  `%openenv_user_upn%`. This user only has user level permissions with no useful access to the Azure portal or ARO cluster.

[NOTE]
====
Both users have been assigned the temporary password `%bastion_password%`. You *must* change this password when you first log into the Azure portal.
====

=== Azure Portal and change admin password

. Open a new web browser window/tab and log into the Azure Portal by navigating to https://portal.azure.com.
. Use `%openenv_admin_upn%` as the user id and `%bastion_password%` as the password to log into the portal.
. You will be prompted to change your password. Use `%bastion_password%` as the current password and pick a password that you will remember throughout this lab. Make sure this password is reasonably complex. An example could be `Firstname-Lastname-Admin2023` (using your first and last name).
. Click `Maybe Later` when asked if you want to take a tour of the Azure portal.

=== Explore ARO

. In the search bar at the top type *aro* and then click on *Azure Red Hat OpenShift Clusters*.
+
You will see your cluster `aro-cluster-%guid%`.

. Click on your cluster to open the cluster properties.
. Click on *Settings* -> *Properties* to bring up the cluster overview.

== Log into OpenShift using Azure Credentials (Optional)

WARNING: This section is optional and is not necessary to complete this lab.

CAUTION: After this section make sure to log in as an administrator to complete the rest of this lab.

Now that your password has been changed for the Azure admin account you can use single sign on to log into your OpenShift cluster.

. Navigate back to the OpenShift console at %aro_console%.
. Click on the username at the top right and `Log out`.
. When logging back in, this time click on `AAD` when prompted for which authentication provider to use.
. Use `%openenv_admin_upn%` as the user and the password that you set for the Azure portal to log into the console.
+
[TIP]
====
If you are still logged into the Azure portal in the same browser this will be easy - Azure will present you with a list of users. Simply select your admin user. And because this is single sign on you will not even have to provide your password.
====

. Also log into the terminal window that you have been using so far using the same user.
+
On the top right of the OpenShift web console click on your user and then *Copy login command*.

. Confirm by clicking on `AAD` and selecting your account again.
. Click on *Display Token*
. Copy the displayed login command under *Log in with this token* and paste it into the terminal window to log in with that user.
. Double check that you are logged in as your Azure user:
+
[source,sh,role=execute]
----
oc whoami
----
+
.Sample Output
[source,texinfo,options=nowrap]
----
openenv-admin-%guid%@azure.opentlc.com
----

You now have full admin access to both the Azure console and the OpenShift console.

CAUTION: Remember to log in as an administrator to complete the rest of the lab if you chose to log in as the regular user.
