== Overview

You can access environment variables as flattened `{}`-surrounded variables in these templated AsciiDoc files.

=== Variables from ENV as AsciiDoc attributes

NOTE: JSON objects are flattened and joined with a `.`.
As a side-effect of the `.`, any character will match the `.` in the variable name.
